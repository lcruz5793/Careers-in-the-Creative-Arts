##There are four tracks for the event. Each track will have four presentations. The tracks are
- Creative Writing (anything to do with writing: fiction, books, poetry, plays, musicals)
- Fine Arts (painting, photography, sculpture etc)
- Performing Arts (acting, theatre, dance, music)
- Media Arts (graphic design, web design, film making, animation)

##The day will go as follows:
- Registration and Opening remarks: Everyone together in Richard Harris Terrace
- Session 1: each track has a session (four at the same time). Each track is in a separate location.
- Session 2: each track has a session (four at the same time). Each track is in a separate location.
- LUNCH: Everyone together in Cafeteria
- Session 3: each track has a session (four at the same time). Each track is in a separate location.
- Session 4: each track has a session (four at the same time). Each track is in a separate location.
- CLOSING remarks: Everyone together in the Richard Harris Terrace

After the opening remarks the sessions start. The sessions are divided into the tracks
I'm listing the track with the session title. You don't have to do it exactly that way as long as it is clear which session is for which track and what time it is.

These track presentations will all run at the same time. Student will have to choose which one they want to attend.

##UX Considerations
Your job for this page is to make sure people can what is going on throughout the day and see which track each session is for. It should be easy to scan the page to make sure that people can look by Workshop, look by time, find room numbers and read the titles.

It would be nice if you add some cross linking to link the session titles here to the descriptions from the sessions page. That is not required for the Midterm version but those are the kinds of things to think about adding for the final.

##Speaker Names
I did not include the speaker names for the sessions. You can add this if you like and may want to add a link to the speaker bio as well.
